            <p class="UCBody"> 
                The process of creating and maintaining information systems is 
                called systems development or systems analysis and design. This diagram shows 
                that it involves all five components of an information system. In addition to 
                technical knowledge, it requires business knowledge and management skill.

            <h2>Programing Languages</h2>
            <p class="UCBody">
                Programming languages can be added to several different sections in your 
                resume, but the most popular one is your skills section. Here’s how to add 
                programming languages to the skills section of your resume: List the 
                programming languages you know, one line for one language, if you know just 
                a couple of languages.

            <h2>The Importance of Embracing New Technology</h2>
            <p class="UCBody">
                As developments over the past few years have shown, we are in a time of 
                unprecedented technological growth which shows no signs of slowing down. 
                This has caused upset and disruption on a huge scale as the impact of new, 
                cutting-edge technology is beginning to be seen now in every industry. As 
                with any technological revolution, in order to avoid being made obsolete, 
                existing companies will need to ensure they take advantage of these new 
                opportunities to improve their business, products and services. If they 
                don’t, newer and more consumer friendly options will be chosen by the customer.
                In this series of blogs, we will examine the impact that the introduction 
                of a new technology has and the changes that are occurring with the arrival 
                of blockchain and other disruptive technologies. As part of this investigation, 
                the importance and the benefits of implementing new technology solutions will be 
                discussed, along with the dangers of ignoring them. As well as this, the 
                articles will look at a previous example of a disruptive new technology 
                — the internet — and how it changed industries, along with the possible 
                lessons that can be learned and applied to this new technological revolution.
                Additionally, some of the new technologies, and how industries can best prepare 
                to adapt to their upcoming impact, will be discussed. Along the way, we’ll also 
                explain how Blockpass fits into all of this.

                The Benefits and Dangers of Innovation, here.
                What is technological transformation and why is it important?
                “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change” — Charles Darwin (1809–1882)
                Technological transformation, also referred to recently as digital transformation, has been a hot topic in recent years, with many businesses seeking to implement new technology to gain an edge on their competition. In essence, technological transformation is simply the process of developing a company through the application of a new technology in order to provide better products or services, or to achieve savings through reducing costs, reducing time or otherwise making processes more efficient.
                By leveraging new technology, especially when coming to it ahead of the curve, there are two highly desirable ways in which a company may see beneficial results.
